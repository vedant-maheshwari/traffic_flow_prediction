This project combines Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to accurately predict traffic flow by capturing temporal dependencies in traffic data.

**DATASET**

The medium version of the PeMSD7 dataset is the one 
we will use for this application. Using the Caltrans 
Performance Measurement System (PeMS), traffic 
speed data from 39,000 sensor sites was gathered during 
the weekdays in May and June 2012 to create the original 
dataset. In the medium form, we will only take into 
account 228 stations spread throughout California's 
District 7.
